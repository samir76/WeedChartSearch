Leaves Very narrow blades, 14-110 cm long, hairless, flat or somewhat rolled inward. Rim of hairs where the sheath meets the blade (ligule). Flowers Thin, spike-like head 15-50 cm long, which matures from greyish-green to yellowish or reddish-brown. With several long branches held closely to stem, but sometimes drooping. Fruit and Seeds Spikelets 1.5-2 mm long contain a single tiny flower inside a pair of bracts (glumes), which become yellowish-brown seeds and separate from the spikelet. Habitat Pastures, roadsides, waste areas, open woodlands, grasslands, wetlands. Distinguishing Features Very difficult to distinguish from other Rats tail grasses (Sporobolus species) but the combination of large size and closely held branches in the seed head may help to distinguish it.",

    desc: "Yellow soldier belongs to a group of South African plants, many of which are grown as garden ornamentals. Three other species of Lachenalia are weeds of Western Australia. \r\nLeaves: Yellow soldier has two strap-shaped leaves, 60–350 mm long and 15–25 mm wide, which grow upwards from the base. The leaves are slightly V-shaped in cross-section.\r\nFlowers: The bright yellow flowers are 25 mm long and more or less tubular in shape but swollen in the middle. They grow on short stalks just 45–100 mm above the ground. Large healthy plants can produce up to ten yellow upright flowers. Plants flower particularly well following fire and set prolific amounts of seed.\r\nStems: Yellow soldier stores food material for the next growing season in bulbs, which are short underground stems.\r\nSeeds: The smooth, shiny black seeds are about 2 mm long. The seed does not appear to remain viable in the soil for more than two or three years.",
